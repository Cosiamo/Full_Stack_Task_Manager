# Full Stack Project

I made this for fun and as a way to try full stack mobile development. 

I'm enjoying it so far, however this is the first project I ever had a problem using git. Usually I make commits without any issue but I've had so much trouble trying to commit the Go code and the Dart code in the same remote repo.
